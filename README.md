# 02 Portfolio

## Description
This web page was developed to show case my web development skills to potential employers and also to practice these skills. In particular it demonstrates HTML and CSS skills.

Noteworthy CSS features are:

- flex
- media queries
- pseudo classes
- variables
- box-shadow

The main challenges were with layout and ensuring the web page was usable at various screen sizes. Flex and media queries were used to achieve this.
